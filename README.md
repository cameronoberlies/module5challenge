##Work Day Planner

##Used jQuery, Bootcamp, and dayjs libraries. For this planner data was needed to be saved to the local storage, <divs> were given multiple classes that were to be interchanged depending on the time of day. I used the preventDefault function so the event saved into local storage persists after reloading the page.
